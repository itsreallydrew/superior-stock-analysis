# Superior Stock Analysis

This application is a stock tracker based off the stocks recommended by Youtuber Chris Sain. It provides a variety of pertinent information regarding a particular stock at any given time in the stock market.

This application makes use of the API from IEX Cloud to supply the financial information.

## Inspiration

The stock market is always a popular topic among those interested in increasing their finances. My best introduction was through watching videos by Chris Sain. One of his followers put together a stock tracker using an excel spreadsheet. I used that information to build out a JSON file containing the initial seed data for the stocks.
